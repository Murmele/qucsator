Here are listed all the hackers who helped creating this package:

Michael Margraf <Michael.Margraf@alumni.TU-Berlin.DE> for having the
	initial idea of writing a free circuit simulator.  Thanks for
	sharing his excellent microwave knowledge.  Also for partly
	implementing the noise simulation.

Jens Flucke <jens.flucke@gmx.de> for making up the first draft of the
	homepage.  Also for motivating the project.

Vincent Habchi, F5RCS <10.50@free.fr> for testing the simulator, giving
	good hints how to improve its functionality and initiating the
	coplanar issues.

Raimund Jacob  <raimi@lkcc.org> for wildly testing the application and
	for applying patches to CVS during my time in Munich.  Also for
	documenting the grammars used in Qucs's data files.

Gunther Kraut <gn.kraut@t-online.de> for his contributions to the equation
	solver evaluation.
