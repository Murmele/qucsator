Bug:         B0001
From:	     Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2004-10-19/stefan)
Date:	     2004-09-01
Description: Parallel coupled microstrip models do not work.  In fact the
	     characteristic impedances for even and odd mode are wrong.
Fix:	     Found the appropriate publication by Kirschning.

Bug:         B0002
From:	     Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2005-03-01
Description: Depending on the netlist input order it may occur that a DC
	     analysis converges or does not converge.

Bug:         B0003
From:	     Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2005-03-01
Description: Noise correlation matrices of microstrip components can't be
	     calculated assuming a simple attenuation.

Bug:         B0004
From:	     Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2005-03-01
Description: Noise correlation matrices of microstrip components can't be
	     calculated assuming a simple attenuation because of the
	     transition time effects.

Bug:         B0005
From:	     Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2005-03-01
Description: Output resistance of the BJT model is much too high.
