2005-12-12  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucs_producer.cpp: Added new temperature and area
	parameters for QucsLib output of diodes.

	* parse_spice.y: Allowing translation of area parameter.

2005-12-10  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucs_producer.cpp: Using new hash template to increase
	speed during spice node list creation.

2005-11-12  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Fixed diode node translation.  Implemented
	translation of three mutual inductors.

2005-10-13  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucs_producer.cpp: Redefined 'qucslib' output format to
	accord to the library manager data format.

2005-06-10  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* scan_spice.l: Skipping the .control -> .endc interactive
	section in SPICE files.  Also handling the optional 0x1a
	character at the end of SPICE netlists.

2005-05-25  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Fixed a segfault bug occurring if there is
	an untranslatable device model.

2005-05-15  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucs_producer.cpp (qucslib_producer): New producer in the
	converter tool implemented.  It outputs templates for device
	models for diode, jfet, mosfet and bjt including a symbol.
	The functionality can be used in future for device libraries.

	* check_spice.cpp: The spice checker now also collects the
	available .MODEL statements.

2005-04-30  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucs_producer.cpp: Fixed reference node implementation in
	order to pull the ground node outside the circuit definition
	througout the subcircuits in the original netlist.

2005-04-27  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Collecting potential external and overall
	nodes in the netlist.

	* qucs_producer.cpp: Printing node lists as comments.

	* qucsconv.cpp: Added new command line option '-g' which can
	be used to rename the 'gnd' node to some other name.  Useful
	for subcircuit definitions.

2005-03-16  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* Makefile.am:  Avoid re-generation of flex/bison files
	when not in maintainer mode.

2004-12-14  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Translation of device properties only if
	not already adjusted.

2004-11-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Fixed the transformation of mutual
	inductors.

2004-11-23  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* scan_spice.l: Much more restrictive scanner (completely
	rewritten).  Work a lot with flex's state mechanisms.

	* qucsconv.cpp: New command line option --noaction can be
	used to inhibit the output of simulations (actions) into
	the resulting netlist.

	* parse_spice.y: Almostly implemented all of the Spice
	'grammar' in the netlist parser.

	* check_spice.cpp: Implemented evaluation of the .OPTIONS
	directive, subcircuits and the nodeset (initial conditions)
	functionality.

2004-11-10  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* scan_spice.l: Added tokens for yet another number format and
	start and end of subcircuits.

2004-11-04  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Added transformations for current
	controlled sources and mutual inductors.
	
	* check_spice.cpp: Implemented translations for voltage
	controlled sources.  Also create commentary lines for
	untranslated Spice netlist lines.

2004-11-03  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Added transformations for DC, AC and
	transient analysis.

2004-11-02  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Fixed unit conversion routine and added
	voltage source transformations.

2004-10-31  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Implemented node, property and unit
	transformations.

2004-10-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucsconv.cpp: Started to implement a netlist conversion
	program.
