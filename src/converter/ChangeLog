	* Makefile.am:  Avoid re-generation of flex/bison files
	when not in maintainer mode.

2004-12-14  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Translation of device properties only if
	not already adjusted.

2004-11-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Fixed the transformation of mutual
	inductors.

2004-11-23  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* scan_spice.l: Much more restrictive scanner (completely
	rewritten).  Work a lot with flex's state mechanisms.

	* qucsconv.cpp: New command line option --noaction can be
	used to inhibit the output of simulations (actions) into
	the resulting netlist.

	* parse_spice.y: Almostly implemented all of the Spice
	'grammar' in the netlist parser.

	* check_spice.cpp: Implemented evaluation of the .OPTIONS
	directive, subcircuits and the nodeset (initial conditions)
	functionality.

2004-11-10  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* scan_spice.l: Added tokens for yet another number format and
	start and end of subcircuits.

2004-11-04  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Added transformations for current
	controlled sources and mutual inductors.
	
	* check_spice.cpp: Implemented translations for voltage
	controlled sources.  Also create commentary lines for
	untranslated Spice netlist lines.

2004-11-03  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Added transformations for DC, AC and
	transient analysis.

2004-11-02  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Fixed unit conversion routine and added
	voltage source transformations.

2004-10-31  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* check_spice.cpp: Implemented node, property and unit
	transformations.

2004-10-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucsconv.cpp: Started to implement a netlist conversion
	program.
