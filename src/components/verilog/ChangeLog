	* qucsMODULEgui.xml: Added some code for mosfets.  Still something
	to do (symbol).

2007-12-19  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* hicumL2V2p22.va, hicumL2V2p11.va: Avoiding singular matrices due
	to V(br) <+ 0.0 statements.  Converted to I(br) <+ V(br)/1e-6
	statements which is a tiny resistor instead of a real short.

	* qucsVersion.xml: 'case' now works for both real and integer
	arguments. Statements like 'case (0) a: b=1; endcase' are now also
	correctly translated.  TODO: String comparisons.

2007-12-18  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* hicumL2V2p22.va: Added new device: HICUM L2 v2.22 model.

	* qucsVersion.xml: Loads of changes enabling the code to translate
	ddx() statements.  Also improved 'case' handling (variable
	assignment detection inside 'caseitem' code).  ADMS version 2.2.8
	is now required (currently in SVN only).

	* mod_amp.va: Added new verilog device: Modular OpAmp.  Thanks to
	Mike Brinson!

2007-12-11  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* qucsVersion.xml: Implemented $strobe() and $finish() corretly
	now.  Simple (only for numeric case items) but working 'case'
	implementation added.

	* analogfunction.xml: Initializing local variables in analog
	functions.

2007-04-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* hicumL2V2p11.va: Applied some changes which makes the file
	minimally differ from the original source file.

	* qucsMODULEcore.xml: Updated all admst-scripts due to changed CR
	handling of new adms-2.2.5 release.

	* qucsVersion.xml, analogfunction.xml: Fixed definition of
	limexp() and its derivative.  Also fixed $vt() translation.

	* verilog/qucsMODULEdefs.xml: Fixed bug in (-inf:inf) parameter
	range handling.

	* verilog/qucsMODULEcore.xml: Moved Verilog evaluation into a
	initVerilog() and calcVerilog() function.

2007-04-05  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* verilog/qucsVersion.xml: Some more cleanups.  Also fixed
	a bug for analog function calls.  Thanks to Laurent.

	some minor bugs.

	* verilog/qucsMODULEcore.xml: Added HB simulation callbacks.

	functionality.

	transient analysis.  Also fixed a bug in the transient analysis.
