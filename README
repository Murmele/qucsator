You can always get the latest Qucsator version from our SVN
repository.  Please use an official release if you want to work with
Qucsator.  The SVN version might not even compile.

    $ svn co https://qucs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qucs/trunk/qucs-core


Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.  Run `sh autogen.sh' and
`configure' with the appropriate options.  Maintainance currently
requires Autoconf version 2.57 and GNU automake 1.7.0.
